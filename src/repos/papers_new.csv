Since 2012, several Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) models have been proposed such as AlexNet [1], VGG [5], GoogleNet [6], Residual Net [7], DenseNet [8], and CapsuleNet [9][65]. A DL based approach (CNN in particular) provides state-of-the-art performance for classification and segmentation tasks for several reasons: first, activation functions resolve training problems in DL approaches. Second, dropout helps regularize the networks. Third, several efficient optimization techniques"
