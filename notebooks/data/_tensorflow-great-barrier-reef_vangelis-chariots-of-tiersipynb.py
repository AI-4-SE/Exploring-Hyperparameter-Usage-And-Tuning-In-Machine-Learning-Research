# "Vangelis, who gave the movie Chariots of Fire its signature synth-driven sound, has died. He was 79 years old. He was born Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiou in the Greek town of Agria. And he was a self-taught musician who became a young piano prodigy. Then he moved to Paris and co-founded the popular prog-rock group Aphrodite's Child. The band eventually split and Vangelis got a solo record deal with RCA Records."
# 
# "In 1981 he composed the score for Chariots of Fire. Its opening theme, with its uplifting inspirational swell and ornate arrangement, was released as a single and reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100. His efforts earned him a win for best original score at the Academy Awards."

# 
# "Chariots of Fire was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four, including Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Original Score for Vangelis' electronic theme tune.

# 
# "The film's title was inspired by the line "Bring me my Chariot of fire!" from the William Blake poem adapted into the British hymn "Jerusalem"; the hymn is heard at the end of the film. The original phrase "chariot(s) of fire" is from 2 Kings 2:11 and 6:17 in the Bible."
