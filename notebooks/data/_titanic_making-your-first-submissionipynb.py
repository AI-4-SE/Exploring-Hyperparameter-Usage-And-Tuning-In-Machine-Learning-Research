# # **Make your first submission**
# 
# This notebook will walk you through all the basic steps required to make your first submission. This is an attempt to share my learnings with you.
# <br> This book can be a good starting point if you are new to Kaggle or new to competitions (like me ðŸ˜…)
# 
# Note: This book is not a good source to better understand data or for ML modelling.

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session


# **What should your submission look like**

# In[ ]:


sample_submission = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/jpx-tokyo-stock-exchange-prediction/example_test_files/sample_submission.csv')
sample_submission.head(5)


# In[ ]:


training_data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/jpx-tokyo-stock-exchange-prediction/train_files/stock_prices.csv')
training_data.head(5)


# The stocks are ranked based on the column 'Target'. The calculation for the 'Target' column will be discussed in the subsequent cells. 
# <br>The returns are then calculated by considering long positions on the top 200 ranked stocks and short positions on the stocks ranked 1800-1999. You can find the function for this under competition overview. 

# ## Calculations for the 'Target' column
# 
#    ![image.png](attachment:cd34873f-b65b-4522-888b-d4c2781c2f55.png)
#    
#    The target column is calculated based on the closing prices of t+2 and t+1 days. 
#    
#    <br> To understand this better lets consider just one security.

# In[ ]:


tmpdf = training_data[training_data["SecuritiesCode"]==1301].reset_index(drop=True)
tmpdf.head(5)


# In[ ]:


tmpdf["Close_shift1"] = tmpdf["Close"].shift(-1)
tmpdf["Close_shift2"] = tmpdf["Close"].shift(-2)

tmpdf["rate"] = (tmpdf["Close_shift2"] - tmpdf["Close_shift1"]) / tmpdf["Close_shift1"]
tmpdf


# Note: In the above table you can verify the target column with the values in the rate column

# ### Ranking
# Now that we have understood how the 'Target' is calculated lets move on to ranking. 
# <br> Ranking is pretty straightforward. A rank is assigned to the security for each day based on the magnitude of 'Target'. Higher the 'Target' value smaller the rank and vice-versa. 
# 
# Ranking all the securities in the training table.

# In[ ]:


training_data['Rank'] = training_data.groupby('Date')['Target'].rank(ascending=False,method = 'first') - 1
#The '-1' at the end is very important. If not used it might throw an error during the final submission since the ranks need to be between 0 and 1999

# The dataset which will be updated timely and should be used for the final submission is 

# In[ ]:


stock_prices = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/jpx-tokyo-stock-exchange-prediction/supplemental_files/stock_prices.csv')
stock_prices.head(5)


# In[ ]:


stock_prices['Date'].max()


# ### Note: I will be skipping the spread return calculations for the time being. But you can find the function which is used to calculate this in the the competition overview (Sharpe Ratio)

# To understand how submission is going to work we will calculate and submit ranks for the last date available to us i.e 2022-02-28

# In[ ]:


stock_prices['Rank'] = stock_prices.groupby('Date')['Target'].rank(ascending=False,method = 'first') - 1
stock_prices = stock_prices.fillna(0)
stock_prices['Rank'] = stock_prices['Rank'].astype(int)

final_day = stock_prices[stock_prices["Date"]=="2022-02-28"].reset_index(drop=True)
final_day


# In[ ]:


final_day_dict = dict(zip(final_day["SecuritiesCode"],final_day["Rank"]))


# Create the environment.
# These 3 lines of code are also provided in the competition overview

# **For understanding how submission is done we will use the same ranks as on 2022-02-28 and just map them to the respective securities in sample_submission**

# After running the notebook till this point you need to do the following

# After this click on save version, give it a name and click save. 
# 
# Now go to the competition overview page and click on submit prediction, select the correct name and version of your notebook and hit submit. 
# 
# This will be your first submission. 
# <br> You can check your score on the leaderboard and under my sumbissions.  

# ### Thank you for reading
